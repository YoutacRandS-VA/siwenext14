This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

This is a Next.JS 14 App using RainbowKit to Sign In With Ethereum and create NextAuth session.

Most is straightforward but make sure to change your Next.config.mjs file to what I have here or it won't work.  

Thanks to OxRowdy and his example here at https://github.com/0xRowdy/nextauth-siwe-route-handlers .  Had to tweak a few things from this to make it work, but OxRowdy's example got it 90% there.
